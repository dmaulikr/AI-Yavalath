# AI-Yavalath
Alpha-beta search algorithm with killer-move and history heuristics

For one of my modules, Artificial Intelligence for games and puzzles, I implemented a native iOS app of a game called Yavalath.
The main focus of the assignment was to implement the algorithms for the computer player (an alpha-beta search algorithm with killer-move and history heuristics). The GUI was not required but I decided to implement a very simple interface for learning purposes.
